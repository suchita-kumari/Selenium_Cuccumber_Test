It enables you to write and execute automated acceptance/unit tests.
It is cross-platform, open source and free.
Automate your test cases with minimal coding.

Documentation
-------------
* [Installation](doc/installation.md)
* [Predefined steps](doc/canned_steps.md)

Download a Framework
--------------
* Maven - https://github.com/suchita-kumari/Selenium_Cuccumber_Test

Writing a test
--------------

The cucumber features goes in the `features` library and should have the ".feature" extension.

You can start out by looking at `features/login.feature`. You can extend this feature or make your own features using some of the [predefined steps](doc/canned_steps.md) that comes with framework


Predefined steps
-----------------
By using predefined steps you can automate your test cases more quickly, more efficiently and without much coding.

The predefined steps are located [here](doc/canned_steps.md)

Running test
--------------

Go to your project directory from terminal and hit following commands
* `mvn test (default will run on local firefox browser)`
* `mvn test "-Dbrowser=chrome" (to use any other browser)`

Using canned tests in your project
----------------------------------

In your TestRunner class add a glue option: ExtendedCucumber runner has been used

The use of Extended Cucumber runner is similar to standard runner. Actually it is wrapper above the standard Cucumber runner object. [For more details](http://mkolisnyk.github.io/cucumber-reports/extended-cucumber-runner)

        glue = { "info.seleniumcucumber.stepdefinitions" })

public  class RunSmokeTest extends ExtendedTestNGRunner {
}





```

Test Report
--------------
Overview report cucumber-results-feature-overview.html can be investigated further (generated under target). 
Overview section contains aggregated information on run status per features/scenarios/steps. Itâ€™s some kind of results summary.
